Target browsers tailored to your audience.

## Why should I care?

Browsers update very often these days, with major releases getting published every month.
With each new browser version comes support for new web platform features.
Thanks to open source projects such as Autoprefixer and Babel we are able to use these features while supporting older browsers.
But this backward compatibility comes with a cost.
We can't really keep adding prefixes, polyfills and other fallbacks to support every browser ever invented.

Browserslist is an open source project that can minimize those costs by allowing you to configure which browsers you care about.
It is supported by tools such as
[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer),
[babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env),
[postcss-normalize](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-normalize) and many others.
Here's how you configure Browserslist:

```yaml
> 1%              # I want to support browser versions that have more than 1% of global usage
Last 2 versions   # And the latest 2 versions of each browser
IE 9              # And also Internet Explorer 9 specifically
```

The global browser usage data comes from [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) and is downloaded from npm when you runÂ `npm install`.
Package managers such as npm and Yarn will generate a lockfile with the exact version of each package that was installed.
This means the caniuse database that is used to perform these queries will always be the same.
This is great because it's predictable, but it's important to update this package from time to time to keep up with the latest stats.
Apart from remembering to update this package, there's something else you should consider:

- For instance, in China there are some popular browsers that are not used in the US and Europe.
- Or maybe your audience uses mostly mobile browsers.
- Or maybe you are building an application for the government and need to support Internet Explorer 8.

The point being, it's important to make decisions based on your audience.
Browserslist-GA aims to help you with that.
It integrates Google Analytics with Browserslist to keep your targeted browsers updated.
